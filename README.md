# Hospitality-Project-USING-power-BI
I have created a POWER BI DASHBOARD for HOSPITALITY BUSINESS

OBJECTIVE:
A hotel chain wants us to help them create a dashboard to track and analyze their performance across India.

This project involves following steps:
Data collection, Data cleaning and wrangling, Data modeling, Data visualization, Data- Dashboard designing (In Power BI)

INSIGHTS:
•	Key performance indicators (KPIs) used to determine the Revenue, RevPAR (revenue per available room), Occupancy Percentage, Average rating, Realization percentage, ADR (Average Daily Rate) 
•	In the weekend-weekday table we have considered weekends to be Friday and Saturday as it is the industry standard in hospitality business and rest of the days are taken as weekdays.
•	 Percentage revenue table by category shows how much each category of room which are luxury and business rooms are contributing.
•	Occupancy percentage, ADR and RevPAR in the basis of weeks helps the owners determine what is causing any in wanted drops in performance by comparing between the values and can fix ADR depending on the findings.
•	Property by Key Metrics tables helps us understand the status of each property and we can easily determine which are the properties that are struggling the most, how much Revenue they are generating and what rating do they have, this will help them to take further steps to boost the performance of those properties.

PROJECT LEARNINGS:
•	Import and transform the data in Power BI and created new measures using DAX equation
•	Created interactive dashboard to track and analyze online sales data
•	Used complex parameters to drill down in worksheet and customization using filter and slicers
•	Created connections, join new tables, calculations to manipulate data and enable user driven parameters for visualizations
